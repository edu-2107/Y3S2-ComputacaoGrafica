## Project


### 2. Flower

#### 2.2 Parameterizing the flower
We were unable to achieve the desired curvature for the flower, resulting in the flower appearing as shown in the image below.

**Figure 1:** Flowers without curvature


### 5. Pollen and Hives

We encountered difficulties in implementing the bee's descent to the flower to collect pollen and subsequently deposit it in the hive.


### 7. Additional developments

Since the bee could not pick up the pollen, we were also unable to animate its descent and ascent along a parabolic trajectory.
